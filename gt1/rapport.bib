SensLAB's main and most important goal is to o er an accurate open access multiusers scienti c tool to support the design, the development tuning, and the experimentation of real large-scale sensor network applications. The SensLAB testbed is composed of 1024 nodes over 4 sites. Each site hosts 256 sensor nodes with speci c characteristics in order to o er a wide spectrum of possibilities and heterogeneity. Within a given site, each one of the 256 nodes is able both to communicate via its radio interface to its neighbors and to be con gured as a sink node to exchange data with any other "sink node". The hardware and software architectures that allow to reserve, con gure, deploy rmwares and gather experimental data and monitoring information are described. We also present demonstration examples to illustrate the use of the SensLAB testbed and encourage researchers to test and benchmark their applications/protocols on a large scale WSN testbed.}},

    heterogeneity, the number of link lay ers, MAC
      protocols, and underlying transportation mechanisms
      increases. System developers must adapt their
      applications and systems to accommodate a wid e
      range of underlying protocols and
      mechanisms. However, existing communication
      architectures for sensor networks are not design ed
      for this heterogeneity and therefore the system
        developer must redevelop thei r systems for each
          underlying communication protocol or mechanism. To
          remedy this situation, we present a communication
          architecture that adapts to a wide range of
          underlying communication mechanisms, from the MAC
          layer to the transport layer, without requiring any
          changes to applications or protocols. We show that
          the architecture is expressive enough to accommodate
          typical sensor network protocols. Measurements show
          that the increase in execution time over a
          non-adaptive archit ecture is small.},
