\subsection{Application}

\subsubsection{Different ranking methods}

One of the main problem for a paper to be read is the reference. It's
quite hard for a new paper to be as well-referenced than an old one.

But new scientists need to read all the classical and seminal 
articles before start to read the most recent one.

In order to satisfy this two requirements, two ranking system will
be installed. One will be based on the amount of reference that an
article can get. And the other one with a mix of publication date,
reference in other article, and h-index of scientists.

The main goal here is to provide a quick and efficient way for
experienced scientists to read easily the new article of their fields
and for new one to get quickly the ''must read`` of their field.

\subsubsection{Simplified accounts}

\textit{Only hashes and file pointers are needed in order to make an
account to memorize the preferences. We can have a account management
website with very few ressources.}

\subsubsection{RSS utilities}

Stay informed of the current situation of research is a daily
activity for scientists. Conference give regulary good articles but
not all fields are exposed in the released papers. A paper coming from
a small university can be completly ignored if it's not referenced by
other people.

In order to stay in touch with the new article a RSS 
(Really simple syndication) will be provided. It will allow scientists
to follow a specific field of research by using hashtags and a system
of keywords.

\subsubsection{Graphical user interface to manage the current personnal repository}

\textit{The complete personnal repository is manageable by using a command line
tool or by using a graphical user interface.}

\subsubsection{Meta information about files}

\textit{Index files wherever or whatever they are. Indexing sections, subsections
and keywords. Indexing everything that matters.}

\subsubsection{Files distance}

\textit{In order to suggest articles that might be interesting we can use
some keywords parsing in order to see what are the contents that may be more
relevant to a user.}
