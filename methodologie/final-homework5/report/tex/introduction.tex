\section{Introduction}

The software diversity in order to manage references is already
great but no software is completly satisfactory. Scientific and
educational contents are spread in the Internet and there is currently
no way to gather them into a single and simple distributed network of repository.

This paper aims to draw what could be a good solution in order to
spread educational contents and scientific articles in a distributed
way.
