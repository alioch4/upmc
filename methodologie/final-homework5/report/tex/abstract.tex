Reading scientific article is a daily activity for most scientist.
A lot of tools already exists to find a precise article but most of them are
not compatible with each other and they all works on different configuration.

Also, there is not a way for any user to get a lot of papers in one hit and then work
on them offline. They must be connected in order to get them one by one.

This paper aims to describe what should be a P2P network of repository of scientific
content.

This paper could also be useful to people who want to design a delivering education content
system
to students all over the world.
