\section{Results}

According to the previous study of the speed among P2P networks
\cite{Qiu:2004:MPA:1030194.1015508} a fluid model could be used
in order to describe the diffusion of content among a P2P networks.

This study also show that seeds grows quite fast, in large and stable 
network where the probability of disconnection is very low (due to the relatively
stable connection between universities) the increasing rate of seeds is actually
faster. Also the bandwith which is most of the time the main problem into P2P exchange is
now very large because of the large capacity of the network in academic field (Renater in France 
for instance)
