\subsection{A web interface to browse contents}

Scientists cannot always install softwares on their working machines, they also
don't always have the knowledge to do so. In order to avoid this problem, a web interface
can also be provided to repository manager, a repository browser. This solution may work
for people only looking for a very specific article. We can remark that for scientists only
looking for a precise article, our solution is equivalent to the one already installed. There is
no regression with our solution.

\subsection{Security issues}

Security is important for our system. Authentification of the authors and
university is required in order to trust discoveries or publications. Peers
can authentificate themselves by using a certificate. It's quite easy for 
a web site to buy a certificate that will garantee a trustful authentification.
This certificate can be used in order to assure to other peers that they are connecting
with the right repository.
