\section{Conclusion}

We saw in this paper that deploy a P2P system to deliver content is completly
possible and could be very efficient. We also saw that with a system close 
to the one use in SSH system, we can share keys between repository and then
could achieve authentification.

Even if this system could work on a technical level, some help on the political
point of view is required. Because science article is controlled tightly by 
edition company in other organization the deployment of this system could suffer.

A solution could be to use this system in addition with arXiv in order to have a 
simple system to copy a complete repository in large amount of location. ArXiv is 
a very efficient system and it seems clear that it's an actor of the developpement 
of a new and open way to spread articles around.

Distributing computing and networks of repository seems to be a very versatile solutions
to a lot of problems. The technologies of P2P (and especially with Bit Torrent) are mature 
and very efficient, waiting to be used by intrepid developpers and researchers.
