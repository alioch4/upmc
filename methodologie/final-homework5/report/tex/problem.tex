\section{Problem statment}

There is several problem against diffusion of science article.
The main one is political, even if the technical tools are here to
provide easy and scalable softwares, the manager and the people in charge
of copyright and authorization to use a specific papers are not ready 
to move all their data into a not tightly controlled system. Even if some
initiative as arXiv are present, functionnal it's not the rule and a lot 
of scientists cannot post on this website without having problems with authority.

An other problem of this website is the lack of information, even if google scholar
is pretty developped and can analyse a large amount of papers. Result of referencing may 
vary from one search engine to an other and even if the result is quite close of the real 
number the differences may cause troubles for a scientist to have his work reviewed and cited.

Finally we can also say that it's quite difficult for new article to be reviewed and comment 
by a large amount of person for a simple reason. The well referenced articles are in the top results
of pratically every search engine. Even if this result is accurate younger and not so known articles 
may not be found because they are crushed by well referenced one and the more they are ignored the more 
they stay on the bottom.
